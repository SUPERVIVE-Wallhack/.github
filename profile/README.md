## 🔍 What Is the SUPERVIVE Wallhack?

Wallhack is a type of **ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) cheat** that overlays player models and items through all surfaces—walls, trees, hills, buildings. The second someone enters your render distance, you’ll see them outlined like a neon sign.

It works with full customization—distance, color, team indicators, trap highlights, and even loot rarity. You’re not just seeing enemies—you’re reading the entire map like it’s an open book. 📖💀
